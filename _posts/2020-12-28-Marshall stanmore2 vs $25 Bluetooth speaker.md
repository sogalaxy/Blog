When I used $25 bluetooth speaker, It sounds good but a little unsatisify in music.  
First, I consider harman kardon Onyx, but I'm finally buying Marshall stanmore2  

It's bluetooth speaker but I will not use this for portable speaker.  
I used to listen to classical and jazz music.  
Budget limit is $200.

Amazon renewed product is $199.  
I think that speaker is not that sensitive one, so I bought Amazon renewed product.

## conclusion
In Stanmore2, You can hear the clear bass sound.  
This make music have more sense of space and it present better music.  
Even though 10-time expensive speaker does not provide 10time larger satisfaction in music quality, It increase the quality of relaxing.
